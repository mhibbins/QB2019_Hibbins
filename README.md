## Biography 

I am from a small town outside of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. I did my undergraduate degree in EEB at the University of Toronto. Currently, I'm in my second year of the EEB program (with a minor in bioinformatics) at IU, working in the Hahn lab. I am broadly interested in research in population genetics, with a lot of my work focusing on the population genetics of introgression. 

## Course Expectations

1. Gain new quantitative skills that I might be able to apply to my own work

2. Gain a better appreciation for quantitative methods that are often used in ecological research. 

3. Learn best practices version control, coding, and reproducible science.
