## Goal
+ Install and configure Git on your computer

## 1) Git Installation
If you do not have a current Git installation, please do the following:

1. Open a web browser and navigate to git-scm.com/download/
2. Select the appropriate operating system
3. The download should start automatically
4. Open the installer and follow the onscreen directions

  **On Mac**: You will need to make sure you have Xcode Command Line Tools installed.
  To test this type `which g++` at the command line.
  If you get `/usr/bin/g++` as a reply, then you are ready to move on.
  
  **On Windows**: This process will install Git Bash (msysGit). 
  During installation, you will be asked to adjust your **PATH environment**.
  We recommend that you select the option to "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt".
  This will give you the most flexibility with Git.
  In addition, we recommend that during installation you select "Use OpenSSH" for your secure shell client with GitBash.
  
  During installation, you will be asked how to configure the line ending conversions.
  
  **On Mac**: Use"Checkout as-is, commit Unix-style line endings"
  
  **On Windows**: Use "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings"

### 2) Git Test
Before we get started with Git, we first need to test our current installation to make sure there aren't any issues.
The easiest way to do this is to determine what Git version is currently installed.
We will use **terminal** (GitBash on Windows) to accomplish this.

The first thing we need to do is find and start terminal.
On the lab computers, you can find terminal in the **Utilities Folder** in the **Dock** at the bottom of your screen.
On your personal computer: **Mac** you can search for terminal with spotlight [Cmd+Space]; **Windows** you can find GitBash in the Start Menu.

1. Find terminal (or GitBash) and open a new window
2. Type the following commands:

    ```sh
    pwd
    ls
    git --version
    ```

## 3) Git User Configuration
1. **Organization:** We recommend that you create a folder in your user directory (> cd ~) called '*GitHub*' to make this and future assignments easier to manage. (**Mac** Users: Do this from Terminal; **Windows** Users: Do this from GitBash)

    ```sh
    cd ~
    mkdir ./GitHub
    cd ./GitHub
    pwd
    ```
    
2. **User Configuration:** You will need to configure your local Git installation.
We will do this by entering your name and email. 
We will also set two parameters: push.default and credential.helper

    ```sh
    git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
    git config --global push.default simple
    git config --global credential.helper store
    git config --global core.editor "nano"
    ```
    
3. The last thing you need to do is configure how Git handles line endings.
Line endings are invisible characters that your operating system places at the end of each line in a document.
On Unix machines (e.g., Mac), this is the linefeed character (LF).
On Windows machines, this is the carriage-return (CR) and linefeed (LF) characters.
This difference in line endings between Mac and Windows causes incompatibilities between the two systems.
However, Git is enabled to handle the differences by silently converting line endings when repos are pushed to remote servers.
We *strongly* recommend that you configure this behavior in order to prevent any future issues when collaborating across computer platforms.

    **On Mac**

    ```sh
    git config --global core.autocrlf input
    ```

    **On Windows**

    ```sh
    git config --global core.autocrlf true
    ```    
    
**You are now ready to** ***Git !!!***

## 4) Create User
1. Navigate to https://github.com
2. Sign in with your Username and Passphrase
3. On the top right of your screen, click on your Username
4. Click on the Edit Profile Icon to edit your profile<br>

    \includegraphics[height=0.75cm]{images/github_edit_btn.png}

## Fork and Clone a Repo
1. Navigate to the QB student organization: https://github.com/QBstudents
2. Click on the repository (repo) with your name
2. Fork your repo by clicking on the Fork Icon in the top right of your screen<br>

    \includegraphics[width=2cm]{images/github_fork_btn.png}

    You should now see the repo on your GitHub page.

3. Clone the repo onto your local machine using the command line (terminal or GitBash).
Replace "username" with your GitHub username and "repo" with the name of the repo in the QBStudent organization (e.g., QB2017_Lennon)

    ```sh
    cd ~/GitHub
    git clone https://github.com/username/repo
    cd ./Repo
    git status
    ```

The repo should have downloaded onto your local computer and the status should stay "all up to date". 

4. Check and update remote repo location
The following commands will set the location of your **upstream remote repository** on the QB Course GitHub site. 
(In the example below, you will need to replace "repo" with the name of your QB Repository)

    ```sh
    git remote -v
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/QBStudents/repo
    git remote -v
    ```
    You can copy and paste the URL for your upstream repo from the GitHub website.

5. Open and edit the README.md file:

    This file is a Markdown file.
    Markdown is markup language for writing and editing text that can be easily converted to other formats (e.g. HTML, PDF, Word).
    During this semester, we will edit Markdown files using RStudio.
    On the lab computers, you can find RStudio in the **Analysis & Modeling Folder**.
    From RStudio, navigate to and open your README.md file in the root of your student repo.
    Update your '*Student Name*' with your full name. 
    Enter your email address. 
    Write a short biography (~1 paragraph) and share something about yourself that we might not otherwise know. 
    List three to five course expectations. 
    Hint: View the Markdown guide to learn about formatting and making ordered lists <https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/>. 
    When you are done, save the close the document.

6. Now we need to add and commit our changes to git with the following code:

    ```sh
    git status
    git add ./README.md
    git commit -m "Updated README.md with student information"
    ```

7. Now push the changes to GitHub.
Before we push our changes, we always want to check for any changes that others have made; otherwise we can create **conflicts** that need to be fixed. 
We check for these changes using the git commands **fetch** and **merge** as follows:

    ```sh
    git fetch upstream
    git merge upstream/master
    git push origin
    git status
    ```

    You should now see the repo, including your recent changes, on your GitHub page.

8. Navigate to your GitHub page to make sure that the file was uploaded correctly. 
If so, submit a Pull Request to submit your file to the course instructors. <br>

    \includegraphics[height=0.75cm]{images/github_pr_btn.png}
  
    The course instructors can now merge and see your changes.
    
9. To get new assignments, you will pull (fetch & merge) your upstream repo. 
This will allow any updates your instructors have made to be merged with your local documents.
In addition to pulling your upstream repo, you always want to push any updates to your origin.

    ```sh
    git status
    git fetch upstream
    git merge upstream/master
    git push origin
    git status
    ```

During this course, you will receive and submit all assignments using these methods.
In addition, you will use Git and GitHub to contribute to assignments in class and on your personal computers.


## 5) Basic Git and GitHub glossary:
The terms below will be used throughout this class.
Some are commands that you will type into the terminal window. 
All are defined with respect to how we will be using Git and GitHub in this class.
